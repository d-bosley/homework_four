# example of Media Queries

## homework four

The intent for this assignment is to demonstrate the capability of media queries to create responsive site design, down to 800px of resolution. A few different techniques were already employed in the previous attempt for Homework three and then built on top of or reworked for this assignment. Had a lot of difficulties with the form so I was unsure of what to do with it, In the end it was just a lot of retooling with the page structure.
